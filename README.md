# Workspace

Pre-fab workspace for `open-trackers` projects.

This is _optional_. You can always set up your own workspace
independently.

# Setup

Clone all the repositories (including `Workspace`) at the same level in
your project directory.  It should then look like this:

```zsh
$ ls

.github
Daily-Calorie-Tracker-Plus-App
Daily-Calorie-Tracker-Watch-App
DcaltLib
DcaltUI
GroutLib
GroutUI
Gym-Routine-Tracker-Plus-App
Gym-Routine-Tracker-Watch-App
Task-Routine-Tracker-Plus-App
Task-Routine-Tracker-Watch-App
TrackerLib
TrackerUI
TroutLib
TroutUI
Workspace
open-trackers.github.io
```

Then you can open the workspace with: 

```zsh
$ open Workspace/open_trackers.xcworkspace
```
